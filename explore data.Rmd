Note that this code only works if you are working in a project and have a 
data subdirectory with the data from Kiva.

You need a file called library.R with with your library statments.
```{r}
source('library.R')
```

Read in the kiva_loans data.

```{r}
loans <- readr::read_csv(file.path("data","kiva_loans.csv"))
```

```{r}
Hmisc::contents(loans)
```

```{r}
loans <- Hmisc::dataframeReduce(loans)
```

```{r}
Hmisc::contents(loans)
```

```{r}
Hmisc::describe(loans)
```
```{r}
names(loans)
```
Subset the data set to Zimbabwe.
```{r}
Zimbabwe <- loans %>% filter(country == "Zimbabwe")
```

select the fields country and borrower_genders only
```{r}
gender <- loans %>% select(country, ends_with("genders"))
gender
```

Take a look at odd values of borrower_genders
```{r}
loans %>% 
  group_by(borrower_genders) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(n)
```
